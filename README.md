# FiveMResourcePro
A lightning-fast FiveM vehicle resource organizer that transforms scattered files into properly structured resources in seconds.
What is FiveMResourcePro?
FiveMResourcePro is a specialized tool I created to eliminate the tedious process of manually organizing vehicle mods for FiveM servers. As someone who's spent countless hours setting up vehicle resources, I built this tool to make the process virtually instant.

# How to Use
Extract your vehicle files from OpenIV first - this tool cannot process RPF files directly
Drag and drop your extracted folder onto the FiveMResourcePro.exe
That's it! The tool automatically:

Finds and organizes all meta files (vehicles.meta, handling.meta, carcols.meta, etc.)
Creates a properly formatted fxmanifest.lua with all the right entries
Sorts your stream files (YTD, YFT) into the correct directories
Generates a vehicle_names.lua for proper in-game naming
Cleans up unnecessary files



# Why Use This Tool?
What normally takes 5-10 minutes of manual work is done in seconds. The tool:

Eliminates copy/paste errors in your fxmanifest.lua
Ensures consistent folder structure for all your vehicles
Automatically finds files even when they're scattered across multiple subfolders
Provides visual feedback with a modern interface
Shows clear warnings if you've forgotten to extract RPF files

# Important Note
This tool will not work with RPF files! You must first extract the contents of any RPF files using OpenIV or a similar tool before using FiveMResourcePro.
